## Work Instructions ##

*Client*

Louder. is a electronic music label where many of the most famous artists from the underground have a place to make some noise on the mainstream sites and media.


## Assignment

The Louder.'s Team told me that they're interested on having a diferent and non-local way to spread the movement they´re causing nowadays. So I (as the only developer of the site) decided to make a blog about all the info and data they have about their artists and about themself as an company.


## Technical aspects

They contacted a professional researcher to put the best info on the web and get the 1st place on Google´s search results. Then I managed to put that info on the site and make the most simple and understandable design for the public eye.
